        description:"Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name  does not refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product.

These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).Throughout the documentation are indications of a section's stability. Some APIs are so proven and so relied upon that they are unlikely to ever change at all. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous."
